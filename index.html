                <p>I have been learning GCP ( Google Cloud Platform) and am familiar with the technology .I also have worked with many Deep Learning and Machine Learning libraries like TensorFlow, 
                    Keras, PyTorch. I can write basic smart-contracts in solidity.

                <p> I believe that Quantum Computing Truly has the power to change the world! The innovations in the field are simply mind blowing! The applications....endless!<br>
                    I would like to contribute as much as I can to this field</p>

              <h3>Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h3>
             <p>Apart from chaning the paradigm on how we view the world and do work, there is work in many fields that aims to change the status quo.
                 Computer vision, natural language processing are being innovatively used in fields like self-driving, game playing and many more...<br>
                   As someone who is deeply interested in the potential of deep learning, I am excited to see where these technologies will take us in the years to come. 
                   The possibilities for improving our lives and making the world a better place are truly limitless.<br>

            <h3>Blockchain and Decentralization</h3>
            <p> Usually, these terms are currently associated with Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin. But the philosophical and technical ideas behind this is truly ingenious. This is one of those
                'Once-in-a-century' idea which can have huge implications, not only on our financial systems but all other fields like defence, education, etc.
                 As the Youtuber Siraj Raval points <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWOdAAFoSFE">here</a>, we should work towards building Decentralized Artificial Intelligence.
                 That is what I would like to contribute to!

    <p style = "text-align:center"> I believe we are living in a golden age of information. We millennials are the only ones who can differentiate between a time when there was no internet and present age. Hence, I say instead of being scared and intimidated of from this, we should embrace it and utilize it to our best possible ability. I quote the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz by saying that we live in the “best of all possible worlds”. <br>I believe that to “tame this beast” of the internet, we need discipline and integrity and the mental strength…….
    to only take what is really essential and not get distracted by the endless depths of the internet.
        I also believe that excellence is not something that is “inherited” nor “developed” but a mix of both. I believe that even for talent to grow, we need the right guidance and motivation.
        With these principles as pillars to my mental fort, I row in the ocean of life always looking for the big challenges to face and hurdles to cross…….
